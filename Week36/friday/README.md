## Friday Week36

#### Work plan

3. Follow [2. Align Sequences](https://www.megasoftware.net/web_help_10/index.htm#t=Part_I_Getting_Started%2FA_Walk_Through_MEGA%2FAligning_Sequences.htm) tutorial from [MEGAX-Help](https://www.megasoftware.net/web_help_10/index.htm#t=Introduction.htm)
* In the **Aligning Sequences by ClustalW** section, there is an step that says

    ```Exit the Alignment Explorer by selecting Data | Exit Aln Explorer from the main menu.```
    
    Instead of **Exit Aln Explorer**, you will find **Quit**
    
* In the **Aligning Sequences Using Muscle** there is a sentence that tells you that

    ```Near the bottom of the MUSCLE - AppLink window, you will see a row called Alignment Info. You can read information about the Muscle program.```
    
    But I could not find it. If you can't neither, skip this step

* In the **Obtaining Sequence Data from the Internet (GenBank)** section, you will see that the tutorial says

    ```If you have checked more than one box: locate the Display Settings dropdown (located near the top left hand side of the page directly under the tab headings).```
    
    You just have to click on **Summary** drop down menu (Fig1) and follow the next indications.
