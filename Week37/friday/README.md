# Friday Week37 (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

## Work plan

Remember from last week that we did part of the **steps of the phylogenetic analysis**, from sequence retrieve to distance matrix computation (Fig1).

**Fig 1.** Steps of the phylogenetic analysis

This week we are going to explore which substitution model fits best our data, which tree building algorithm to use and how to assess confidence to that tree. During this exercise it is important that you keep all the results (screenshots with notes in a text editor, such as word, for example) that you obtain in the different parts in order to be able to compare them.

### 1. Testing substitution model

Open `primates.meg` data set which is the one from Chapter 3 in Nei and Kumar (you will find it on this week's GitHub folder). With this data choose **Find best model** under the **Model** menu. Run the analysis which will estimate likelihoods for each substitution model available and rank them according to the Bayesian information criterion. For now just accept that the smallest value is best.

Which model is best for this data? Save the Table of model scores since when running some of the tree building methods, you may not be able to use the best model.
What does G and I mean?
What is R? and what is in the 4 columns following the R column?
List the main differences between JC, Kimura, HKY, and Tamura/Nei models, based on Table 3.2 a,b,e below. Relate what you find to question 3 above.
